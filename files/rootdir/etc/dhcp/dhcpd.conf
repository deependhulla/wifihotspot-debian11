# Hosts which require special configuration options can be listed in

# allocated dynamically (if possible), but the host-specific information
# will still come from the host declaration.

# should not also be listed as being available for dynamic assignment.
# Hosts for which fixed IP addresses have been specified can boot using

# be booted with DHCP, unless there is an address range on the subnet
# to which a BOOTP client is connected which has the dynamic-bootp flag
# set.
